# Metis Data Science Bootcamp Prework

Welcome! Congratulations on your acceptance. We hope you are really
excited. We want you to get ready for the bootcamp and have a smooth
experience. This means there is some work to be done before the start
of the bootcamp.

As a first step, please create at account at our [Discourse site](http://162.243.206.168/).
This is a forum that we will use throughout the bootcamp, where we will get to know each other, share materials, ask and answer questions and discuss.

Throughout the prework process, you will install some packages we will use, learn about the command
line tools, get used to Emacs, go through a Python tutorial, and
refresh your statistics background. The time estimates for each step
are there to give you a general idea. Depending on what you are
familiar with and what is new, you may spend less or more at each
step.

As the final step, you will work on some exercises that go along with the statistics refresher. Since they are all python based, they will allow you to both train and assess your python and statistics skills. **There are 6 required exercises.** You can submit the answers to these through email, the details are in the relevant part below.

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions. Please do so 
through the [pre-work support thread](http://162.243.206.168/t/prework-megathread)
on Discourse.

### Installing packages 
###### (30 minutes)
You will first follow the online tutorials for installing some
critical packages that will be used in the course: command line tools,
ipython notebook, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pandas and
git. You can follow our [installation guide](installation.md) to do that.


### Command line
###### (2 hours)
Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours. Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of
these commands and (very briefly) what they do.


### Emacs (or text editor of your choice)
######  (30 minutes)
While we will also use ipython notebooks and the Python IDE during the
bootcamp, in the end the process of coding mostly involves writing
code files in a text editor and running these files with Python. You
can find out about text editors [here](editors.md).


### Python
######  (5 - 9 hours)
We will work with Python (2.7) throughout the course, and [learning and
getting familiar with Python](python.md) is crucial. 


### Statistics
######  (6 - 10 hours)
Time to freshen up your statistics knowledge! We have a [guide](stats.md)
for doing exactly that. The exercises go hand in hand with these, so please check both of them.


### Exercises 
######  (7 - 9 hours)
The 6 required and 6 optional problems are listed [here](exercises.md). Try to do them while you're reading the relevant statistics chapters. It would be ideal if you could submit the answers before the first day of bootcamp. However, if you could not finish in time, you can submit them by the end of the first week. Thank you very much.
